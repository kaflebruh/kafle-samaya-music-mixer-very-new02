Please Note: 

Even though the previous assignmnet (Music Mixer Checkpoint) were done in group by Saddul-Divij and me. 
This is not a group work.
Our idea did not match proeprly and little to no effor were shown by him. So we have mutually decided to work alone. 
I've mail our Program Coordinator about this and I am just letting you know as well.
